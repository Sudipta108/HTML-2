		The day a cricketing drama turned into a mini-series. England's Bodyline tactics had antagonised the Australians before now, but on the second day of the third Test, in Adelaide, all hell broke loose. Bill Woodfull was struck over the heart to conclude a fearsome working-over, and then two days later Bertie Oldfield sustained a fractured skull when he missed a hook. For a while it looked like the whole tour would be called off, but order was eventually restored and England romped home by 338 runs

		The king of parsimony. In the first Test between India and England in Madras, Bapu Nadkarni bowled 21 consecutive maiden overs, a record for six-ball overs, finishing with figures of 32-27-5-0. In the second innings his tight line and length deserted him as he took 6-4-6-2

		A day Anil Kumble will never forget. He became only the second man after Jim Laker to take all ten wickets in a Test innings, against Pakistan in Delhi. His 10 for 74 - all ten came in a spell of 18.2 overs for 37 runs - swept India to their first victory over Pakistan in 23 Tests, dating back to 1979-80. With India in a comfortable position, Mohammad Azharuddin instructed Javagal Srinath at the other end to bowl wide of the stumps; he was twice called for wides as a result.

		A blistering spell of bowling from John Snow set England up for victory in the fourth Test, in Sydney. Snow steamrolled the Australian top order to reduce them to 21 for 4 before finishing the job the next day. He ended up with 7 for 40, and four of the seven were out for nought, including Ian Chappell first ball. The Wisden Almanack said "the pitch was without pace, but Snow... made the ball kick viciously from a worn patch and had his opponents apprehensive from first ball to last."

		A cricketing aesthete is born. Mohammad Azharuddin in full flow was a glorious sight, whipping straight balls through midwicket and carting anything overpitched through the off side. Watching Azhar in his prime was a joyous experience: there were the three hundreds in his first three Tests, the 121 that stole the thunder of Gooch's 333 at Lord's in 1990, and of course that glorious stand with Sachin Tendulkar in Cape Town in 1996-97. But as things stand, Azhar will now be remembered for his involvement in match-fixing rather than his brilliance with the willow.

		India's first Test victory, on their 25th attempt, was set up by left-arm spinner Vinoo Mankad, who cut a swathe through England with 8 for 55 in the fifth Test in Madras. There were four stumpings in the innings, and five in the match, for Khokhan Sen - all off Mankad - both records until Kiran More (with more than a little help from Narendra Hirwani) stumped West Indies in 1987-88. Mankad added four more wickets in the second innings, and with Pankaj Roy and Polly Umrigar making hundreds, an under-strength England side were well beaten by an innings, giving India a share of the series.

		The end of probably the greatest Test series of all. Australia needed 258 to beat West Indies in the fifth Test, at the MCG, and take the series 2-1. At 154 for 2, it looked a formality, but Frank Worrell and Alf Valentine dragged West Indies back into it, and at 236 for 6 it was anyone's game. But the Aussies had "Slasher" Mackay coming in at No. 8, and with two wickets left, he and Johnny Martin scrambled the winning leg-bye just before the close of the penultimate day. A record crowd of 90,800 watched the second day of the Test. After such a mesmeric series, West Indies were bid goodbye in fitting fashion: a new trophy, for which the countries still compete, was established, bearing Worrell's name; and the whole team was given a tickertape farewell parade through Melbourne.

		After England, it was South Africa's turn to get blown away by the Mitchell Johnson menace. He took 12 for 127 - Australia's second-best match figures in South Africa - in the first Test, in Cape Town, to bowl them out for 206 and 200. Shaun Marsh, replacing the injured Shane Watson, made 148 on his comeback, and Steven Smith, also continuing his fine form from the Ashes, made 100. South Africa were inept not only against Johnson's pace but also in the field, giving David Warner four lives in his double-century stand with debutant Alex Doolan (89) in the second innings.

		Ireland's finest hour came courtesy a man with pink hair on this day in Bangalore. Kevin O'Brien smoked the fastest hundred in World Cup history, off a round 50 balls, against the old enemy, England, to help his side pull off one of the great upsets in the game. When England racked up 327 and Ireland lost a wicket off the first ball of their chase before going on to sink to 106 for 4, it had seemed over bar the shouting. Enter O'Brien, who launched a breathtaking assault, plundering 16 fours and six sixes to bring up 113 in 63 balls, and the rest, as they say, was history.

		A miraculous display of big hitting by Carlos Brathwaite secured West Indies their second World T20 title. Needing 19 off the last over in the final at Eden Gardens, Brathwaite launched England's Ben Stokes for four sixes off the first four balls, making his side the first to win two World T20 titles. A combined effort by the bowlers kept England to 155 -Â­ Brathwaite chipped in with three wickets. The mainstay of the chase was Marlon Samuels, whose unbeaten 85 mirrored his heroics in the 2012 final against Sri Lanka.
